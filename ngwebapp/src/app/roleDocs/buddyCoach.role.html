        Roles - Buddy Coach
      </h3>
      <h4>
        Buddy Coach Details
      </h4>
        <p>
          The role of a buddy coach is primarily to support the buddies who are paired with a guest for the evening.
        </p>
      <ul>
<li>Coaches will be assigned to a check-in room where they will lead a huddle for the buddies with some last minute reminders, answer any questions and close with a quick prayer.</li>
<li>During guest arrival time, a coach will be a liaison between guest check-in personnel and the buddies. They will assist with the pairing process by matching the color coded buddy with the guest (red, yellow or green). A quick introduction of the buddy to the guest should take place and parents/guardians should be cued toward the exit.</li>
<li>At about 6:00 most guests should be checked in. Coaches will proceed to their assigned first zone and will rotate approximately every 20 minutes. A map will be provided.</li>
<li>While in their stationed zones, coaches will keep an eye out for any situations that could be diffused and step in if necessary. You should be available to answer questions, sub-in if a buddy needs to use the bathroom or take a short break, and generally support them in any way that may be needed.</li>
<li>At the end of the prom, coaches will return to the same room as during check-in the assist with guest pick up.</li>
      </ul>
